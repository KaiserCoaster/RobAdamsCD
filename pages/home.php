		<p>I’ve spent 20+ years creating award-winning campaigns including advertising, direct marketing, promotions, identity and brand development for B2B and B2C. As Creative Director at non-profit ETS since 2005, I lead the team creating marketing materials for ETS's educational assessment brands, corporate brand and internal communications. I also serve as global brand liason, assisting agencies in creating materials that are on-brand and trademark protected.</p>
		<p>Prior to ETS, I was Creative Director and Partner of the award-winning agency Splinter Group. I’ve held a variety of creative positions, with career clients including AT&T, A&E, BellSouth, Coldwell Banker, Newsweek International, Johnson & Johnson, DuPont, Maxim Group, McCormick, Mercedes-Benz, Spirits Unlimited and FoodTown.</p>
		<p class="highlight-quote">“My creative development has been an ongoing process of learning from the most gifted people and the more challenging projects. Being an effective leader has meant earning the credibility to mentor, gaining the respect of my peers and winning the trust of my clients. Whether I’m nurturing young talent or simply interpreting the client's request versus their need, my ability to forge relationships and communicate has been key. It’s been extremely rewarding leading creative talent to win awards and helping clients reach their business goals.”</p>
