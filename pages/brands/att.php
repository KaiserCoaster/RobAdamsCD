		<p class="lead">“An easy and convenient way to stay connected – from THE brand you can trust.”</p>
		<p>That’s quite a promise – and that’s exactly what AT&T delivered across various channels and markets for their PrePaid line of products. As a working manager, I ensured that all the creative I was responsible for (packaging, card design, direct mail, promotions and advertising) tracked back to a single core promise.</p>
		<p>The emotional connection to “ease and convenience” meant something very unique to each audience segment:</p>
		<li><strong>For callers</strong>, AT&T PrePaid made calling convenient with no bills, no coins, no hassles.</li>
		<li><strong>For retailers</strong> offering prepaid cards in their stores, AT&T PrePaid provided a program that was easy to implement and came with all the support needed to successfully offer customers the biggest brand in prepaid calling.</li>
		<li><strong>For organizations</strong> looking to run promotional campaigns, AT&T PrePaid made it easy to leverage not only the AT&T brand, but also the powerful Star Trek brand alongside their own.</li>
		<li><strong>For collectors</strong>, AT&T PrePaid made collecting prepaid cards easy and convenient through major retail outlets and online avenues, with popular genres like Star Trek and the NBA.</li>
		<li><strong>For gift-givers</strong>, AT&T PrePaid made finding the perfect gift for any occasion easy and convenient through popular retail outlets and online, with cards at multiple price points via a range of denominations.</li>
